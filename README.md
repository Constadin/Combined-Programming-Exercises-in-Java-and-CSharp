Repository of Combined Programming Exercises in Java and C#

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive learning resource for students who want to enhance their programming skills in two fundamental languages: Java and C#. The exercises are structured to cover a range of topics from beginners to advanced, aligned with the sections from the University of Helsinki and Microsoft's C# certification programs.

Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to offer a complete learning experience for Java and C# programming languages, allowing students to understand and compare their features for a smooth transition between the two.

Objectives

Skill Development: Students will deepen their understanding of programming concepts and syntax in both Java and C#. By comparing and analyzing these languages, students gain knowledge of their similarities and differences, preparing them for flexible platform transitions.

Progress Monitoring: Weekly updates ensure continuous learning with new exercises and study materials. Students are encouraged to track their progress and revisit previous exercises for reinforcement.

Collaboration and Feedback: The repository promotes active participation through comments and collaborative discussions among students. Knowledge exchange fosters a supportive learning community.

Skill Demonstration: Completion of the exercise program demonstrates students' proficiency at each stage of their learning journey, validating their knowledge and skills in Java and C# programming.
